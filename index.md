**CISC320 Spring 2023 Lesson 14 - Graph Applications**

Group Members:
* Rachel Robins (rrobins@udel.edu)
* Shreya Pamulapati (shrey@udel.edu)

Description of project

We chose the theme "Campus Life" for our graph applications because 
the topic is relatable to us and provides an endless number of 
related problems to solve. Our first problem, done by Rachel Robins, is
a friendship graph of students in Sparc.

## Installation Code

```sh
$> pip install networkx
```

## Python Environment Setup

```python
import networkx as nx
```
