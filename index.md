# Campus Life Graph Applications

**CISC320 Spring 2023 Lesson 19 - Graph Applications**

Group Members:
* Rachel Robins (rrobins@udel.edu)
* Shreya Pamulapati (shrey@udel.edu)

Description of project

We chose the theme "Campus Life" for our graph applications because 
the topic is relatable to us and provides an endless number of 
related problems to solve. Our first problem, done by Rachel Robins, is
a friendship graph of students in Sparc.

## Installation Code

```sh
$> pip install networkx
```

## Python Environment Setup

```python
import networkx as nx
```

# A Sparc Can Start a Fire

**Informal Description**: 
The problem: You are a student who has just entered Sparc Lab in Smith Hall. The room is full of familiar faces from your classes and around campus. Because the department is relatively small, you decide you want to find out if there is a connection between every student in the room through a friendship with someone else.

> **Formal Description**:
>  * Input: An undirected, and unweighted graph with at least 20 vertices. The vertices are students at the University of Delaware currently in Sparc, and the edges are a friendship between
two students.
>  * Output: If there is a connection between every student, a connected graph of every student in Sparc. Otherwise, a disconnected graph with as many connections among students as possible.
